# Bacteria_to_Beef
In this module we are assisting Roza in completing a panel for demographic information to visualize the bacterial data. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. The project identifies whether the bacteria species is found in the navel.
